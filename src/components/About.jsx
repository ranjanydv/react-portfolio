						I'm {getAge()} years old, a programmer andÂ and I currently live in
						Nepal's capital. At the same time that I work to identify better

						Besides gaming and poetry, I like both of those things.

						As a PHP developer, I began my programming career. Over time, I
						discovered working with Flutter to design and develop apps.
						Nevertheless, working with flutter and creating the backend of
						projects using NodeJS was a novel and forward-thinking experience,
						which made me want to stick with it.
